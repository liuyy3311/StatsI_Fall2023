\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variable is \texttt{difflog}.\\

			\end{verbatim}
		\end{footnotesize}
		
		\noindent The intercept is estimated to be 0.579031, and the coefficient for difflog is estimated to be 0.041666.Both coefficients are highly statistically significant (p-value < 0.001), indicating a significant relationship between the explanatory variable difflog and the outcome variable voteshare.
		The R-squared values suggest that approximately 36.73% of the variability in voteshare is explained by the linear regression model.
		The F-statistic is highly significant, indicating that the model as a whole is statistically significant.
		
		
		
		\item Make a scatterplot of the two variables and add the regression line. 		
		\vspace{.15cm}

		\end{figure}
		\noindent The scatterplot illustrates the relationship between campaign spending (difflog) and the incumbent's voteshare . The regression line suggests a positive correlation, indicating that as campaign spending increases, the incumbent's vote share tends to increase. The points are tightly clustered around the regression line, suggesting a strong linear relationship. However, a few outliers are noticeable, warranting further investigation. 
		\vspace{80.15cm}
		\item Save the residuals of the model in a separate object.

		\vspace{.15cm}
		voteshare = 0.579 + 0.0417  * difflog\\
		\noindent The intercept of 0.579 indicates that the predicted vote share is 0.579 when the campaign spending difference is zero. 
		The coefficient for difflog (0.0417) predicts a unit increase in difflog is associated with 0.0417 increase in vote share.

\section*{Question 5}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger?

			\end{verbatim}
		\end{footnotesize}
		\item Write the prediction equation.	
		\vspace{.15cm}
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=142, lastline=147]{PS3_Yuanyuan_Liu.R} 
		\vspace{.15cm}
		The prediction equation about voteshare is:\\
		voteshare= 0.4486 + 0.0355 *difflog + 0.2569 *presvote\\
		
		The intercept 0.4486 is the predicted voteshare value when both difflog=0 and presvote=0.\\
		The slope of 0.0355 is  associated with difflog when controlling for presvote group.\\
		the slope of 0.2569 is  associated with presvote when controlling difflog. \\
		The equation can be interpreted as follows: for each one-unit increase in difflog, the expected value of voteshare is expected to increase by 
		0.0355 and for each one-unit increase in presvote, the expected value of voteshare is expected to increase by 0.2569
		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?\\
		\noindent Both models have a similar coefficient for the variable of interest (residuals2 in Model 1 and presvote in Model 2). This may suggest a similarity in their impact on the respective dependent variables.
		The statistical significance of coefficients is determined by the p-values (Pr($>|t|$)). In both models, the coefficients have highly significant p-values ($<$2e-16), indicating their significance.\\
		It could be a coincidence that the variable names are similar. If these variables represent different aspects of the data but coincidentally have similar coefficients, the output would reflect this similarity.
